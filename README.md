	##### ECG single electrode implementation using Protocentral's MAX30003 and BBC Micro:bit #####

	This project uses Maxim MAX30003 single-channel ECG board. The info about the board can be found at https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_max30003.
	for Reference about BBC Micro:bit refer http://microbit.org/ .
	We are trying to integrate Micro:bit with Arduino IDE for better use of Arduino libraries and the setting up link can be found here: https://learn.adafruit.com/use-micro-bit-with-arduino/overview
