	######################### ECG single electrode implmentation using Protocentral's MAX30003 and BBC microbit ######################## 
	This project uses Maxim MAX30003 single-channel ECG borad. The info about the borad can be found at https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_max30003.
	for Reference about BBC microbit refer http://microbit.org/ .
	We are trying to integrate microbit with Arduino IDE for better use of arduino libraries and the setting up link can be found here: https://learn.adafruit.com/use-micro-bit-with-arduino/overview
